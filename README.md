Hi! My name is Erin Miller, and I am a current data analytics student.  
  
These repositories contain school projects (private, but I can temporarily grant access for job interview purposes), 
personal projects, and the projects I created during my scholarship time in the Udacity Front End Web Development Nanodegree (sponsored by Grow With Google).
